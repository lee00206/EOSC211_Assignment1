# EOSC211_Assignment1
This is a part of the assignments in Earth and Ocean Science 211 course at UBC.<br>
Assignment 1 analyzes an "estuarine" circulation in the Salish Sea. It uses the data of GPS-tracked drifters into the Strait of Georgia near the mouth of the Fraser River, released by the ODL drifters project (drifters.eoas.ubc.ca).<br><br>
**Part1** shows that all the drift tracks up until either the point of first grounding or the end of the track if the drifter does not ground. Each track line indicates:<br>
* Green tracks exit the northern Strait (i.e. with end point west of 125.19˚W, north of 50˚N)<br>
* Red tracks leave the southern Strait (roughly, with end points south of about 48.78˚N latitude)<br>
* Blue tracks end within the Strait of Georgia<br><br>
Each starting and end points indicate:<br>
* Dark blue markers are the track starting points<br>
* Green markers are the track end points at time of first grounding (if they ground)<br>
* Red markers are the track end points if the drifter never grounds<br>

**Part2** plots a histogram that shows the time to grounding, for all drifters that ground. It also plots the drifter latitude (a proxy for the distance up-Strait or down-Strait of the deployment location) as a function of time. The thick line gives the median drifter latitude, every half-day, from the deployment time to 15 days after deployment.
